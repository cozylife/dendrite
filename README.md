# Dendrite

**Synopsis**
An open source version of Razer Synapse for Linux

**Project Status:** In Development

**Description**
For now, Dendrite will just be a tool to reconfigure the buttons on your Razer Naga 2014 mouse. If there's enough interest in further development, the project *may* grow to support new hardware and features. You're always welcome to create your own additions to the code and create a pull-request.

#Contributing / Building Dendrite
While this project is still in development and without an alpha release, there will not be any ready-made executables. That's because it's still unfinished. However, if you're a developer, and you'd like to contribute, then you can build this project in the open source version of [QT Creator](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/).

All you need to do is open the included .pro file with the QT Creator IDE, and click build. If all goes well, then you can start working on the source code. Only working code will be committed to the repo. If the code has a bug, please repair it or report it in the [issue tracker](issues), as usual.

Once you've built and tested your code, create a pull request, and Travis CI will test 

**Disclaimer - Not a Razer Product!**
This project is built and maintained by the community, and is not a project sponsored by, or operated by, [Razer](https://razerzone.com). If you need support, or you find a bug in this software, do not contact Razer for support. They won't know what you're talking about. Instead, please file a bug report on the [issue tracker for this project](https://github.com/cozylife/dendrite/issues).
